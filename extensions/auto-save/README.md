# What is auto-save ?
* Automatically save file content
* No annoying temporary files need to be cleaned

```Elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-auto-save>") ; add auto-save to your load-path
(require 'auto-save)

(setq auto-save-silent t)   ; quietly save
(setq auto-save-delete-trailing-whitespace t)  ; automatically delete spaces at the end of the line when saving
```
